A Question is a sentence that starts with any of the following: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. You can see the [[Query Words#Words|list of words]] that are used to deduce a question.

## Composite
All questions are composites of other words which have a subject and context. [[SAI]] does its best to extract only the relevant parts of a question and converting them into a code, which can then be accessed later to reference an answer to that question.

## Restraints
Questions, when written, usually have a question-mark at the end to signify that it's a question. This is also nice when chatting back and forth with someone online. Sometimes someone will say something that, without a question-mark, would not be seen as a proper question.

This is all nice and dandy when dealing with people, but not when dealing with machines; machines like predictable input. The way in which we use the English language is all but predictable. To reduce this friction, question-marks are not required to form a question, only the [[Query Words]].

One of the unfortunate caveats of computers, is that they don't have the ability to respond *in-context* with a users input. For example, let's say you're asking questions about art...the AI could suggest all questions relating to art, but it doesn't have the ability to carry on a conversation about specific contexts within the field of art. It is strictly a knowledgebase, not an entity which can subjectively discuss the details of art.
