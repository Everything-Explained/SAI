An algorithmic process of converting some (usually) alphanumeric content, into a number. This number is then usually converted into a smaller base to be represented as letters and numbers. 

Using one of these algorithms, I can turn: `alpha1234` into `3966122707`. This might look manageable, but it's usually best to convert it to a *base36* number: `1tlbrv7`. 

> For the purposes of [[SAI]], the number is left unconverted.

These hashes are unique to the data they represent, which makes them ideal to use as identifiers. The cost in CPU cycles is also very low for conversion, unlike other algorithms in the same vein.
